# PERSONALIZED SHELL FOR ZSH

This script is an integration for the zsh shell. 
It doesn't work on bash or other shells and can create problems if you have oh-my-zsh already installed.
#### It's a project for fun
Recently i started using again linux and i wanted to change my zsh shell because my old one was too boring.

#### Feel free to suggest some change if you like to use it

# USAGE
This shell package come along with an easy personalizable shell and a CLI for UNICO api

### Abilitating the shell
Once you install the whole package, you have to add this line of code at the bottom of your -zshrc file (parsonal and root .zshrc, otherwise you'll not have this shell while on root)
```
source '{zakksh_path}'
```

Then for enabling the UNICO API CLI type these commands
```
sudo cp {unicli_file_location} /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/unicli
```
This because '/usr/local/bin/' is the folder where every command is searched when called on shell.

Nothing more, easy peasy

### PERSONALIZED SHELL FOR ZSH

This script is an integration for the zsh shell. 
It doesn't work on bash or other shells and can create problems if you have oh-my-zsh already installed.
## It's a project for fun
Recently i started using again linux and i wanted to change my zsh shell because my old one was too boring.

## Feel free to suggest some change if you like to use it
